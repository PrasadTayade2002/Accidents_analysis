# Introduction
In this project, our goal is to delve into accident data to extract valuable insights regarding the circumstances and patterns surrounding vehicle accidents.

Utilizing SQL, we aim to efficiently extract, transform, and analyze the dataset. The outcomes of this analysis will be instrumental in understanding the factors that contribute to accidents, paving the way for strategic recommendations to enhance road safety.

Our examination will encompass scrutinizing the interplay between various variables, including area type, day of the week, vehicle age, and weather conditions, and their corresponding influence on accident occurrences and severity.

Furthermore, we will conduct trend analysis to identify and analyze the most critical factors contributing to severe accidents, providing a comprehensive understanding of accident dynamics.

# Datasets
This dataset contains tables, in CSV format:

The Accident table contains information about each accident, including details about the area, weather & light conditions, and severity.

The Vehicle table contains information about vehicles involved in accidents, including details about vehicle type, age, and whether the vehicle is left-hand drive.

# Objectives / Key Questions Answered

Urban vs. Rural Accidents – How many accidents occur in urban areas compared to rural areas?

Vehicle Age Impact – What is the average age of vehicles involved in accidents based on type?

Day of the Week Trends – Which day records the highest number of accidents?

Weather Conditions – Do specific weather conditions contribute to severe accidents?

Impact Location – Are left-hand side vehicle impacts more frequent?

Vehicle Age Trends – Are there identifiable trends in accident rates based on vehicle age?
# Key Insights

Accident distribution differs significantly between urban and rural areas.

Vehicle age plays a role in accident frequency and severity.

Certain days of the week show higher accident counts, indicating behavioral patterns.

Adverse weather conditions increase the likelihood of severe accidents.

Left-side impacts have a notable presence in reported incidents.
