Urban areas have significantly more accidents (58,533) compared to rural areas (21,999).

Actionable Insights:

Focus road safety campaigns and infrastructure improvements in urban areas.

Investigate factors contributing to higher urban accident rates (e.g., traffic density, pedestrian activity).

Allocate more resources to urban traffic management and accident prevention strategies.

2. Day of the week with highest accidents
Friday has the highest number of accidents (12,937), followed by Thursday (12,431) and Wednesday (12,358).

Actionable Insights:

Increase police presence and traffic monitoring on Fridays and Thursdays.

Launch targeted awareness campaigns for end-of-week commuters.

Encourage flexible work hours to reduce peak traffic on high-risk days.

Cars have the highest number of accidents (137,379) with an average age of 8.27 years.

Actionable Insights:

Implement stricter vehicle inspection programs for older cars.

Offer incentives for replacing older vehicles with newer, safer models.

Conduct safety awareness programs targeting owners of older vehicles.

4. Trends in accidents based on vehicle age
Old vehicles (>10 years) are involved in the most accidents (137,141).

Actionable Insights:

Introduce graduated vehicle taxation based on age to encourage newer, safer vehicles.

Enhance safety requirements for older vehicles in annual inspections.

Develop targeted safety campaigns for owners of older vehicles.

5. Weather conditions contributing to severe accidents
Fine weather with no high winds has the highest number of fatal accidents (668).

Actionable Insights:

Increase awareness about maintaining vigilance even in good weather conditions.

Investigate other factors contributing to accidents in fine weather (e.g., speed, distraction).

Implement variable speed limits based on weather conditions.

6. Impacts on left-hand side of vehicles
The majority of accidents (255,480) do not involve left-hand side impacts.

Actionable Insights:

Focus on improving overall vehicle safety features, not just left-side protection.

Investigate factors contributing to the small number of left-hand impacts (1,346).

Ensure driver education covers awareness of potential impacts from all sides.
